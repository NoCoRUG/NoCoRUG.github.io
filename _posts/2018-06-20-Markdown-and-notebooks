## In R group today we're going to begin by learning about [R markdwon](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and how we can use it, along with 
[R Notebooks](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html) to document our work in R in a user-friendly way.

We'll practice with some data about trees collected by students in the Fall 2017 Forest Ecology class at St. Lawrence University.
