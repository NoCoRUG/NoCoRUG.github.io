## Part 1
In the first part of R group today we're going to begin by learning about [R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and how we can use it, along with 
[R Notebooks](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html) to document our work in R in a user-friendly way.

Here is a [link](https://github.com/NoCoRUG/NoCoRUG.github.io/blob/master/files/Rnotebooks.rmd) to the Rmarkdown file used during that part of the presentation.

## Part 2
In the second part of our session, we're going to look at some basic stats.  Conveniently, Ivan also used an R Notebook to capture information for us.  That .rmd file is available [here](https://github.com/NoCoRUG/NoCoRUG.github.io/blob/master/files/IntroStatR-NoCoRUGS.Rmd)
