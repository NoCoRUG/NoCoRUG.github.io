## Welcome to the North Country R Users Group new blog.

Here we will post resources, links to code, etc. from our meetings.
We had a great first gathering of the summer yesterday, with about 18 folks in attendance.  Soon I will be emailing that group with 
updates including a link to this blog post, where I'm listing some resources for learning R.  We have a lot of first-timers in the group.
If you have other resources you like for learning R, let me know, and I'll add them to the list.

By the way, this post is formatted using Markdown - something some have expressed learning more about this summer.  Stay tuned!

## Resources for learning R

* [Ideas from R-bloggers website](https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-learn-r-2/)
* Once you know how to install an R package [the swirl package](http://swirlstats.com/students.html) has a lot of nice lessons.
* Find a good book - there are some discipline-specific choices.  Two I like that would be good for anyone but that use ecological data 
sets as the examples are: 
  * [Getting Started with R](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Started-R-Introduction-Biologists/dp/0198787847/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1527787962&sr=8-1&keywords=Getting+Started+with+R&dpID=41dlsO4%252Bh7L&preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch>)
(which I've assigned as a course text) and 
  * [A beginner's guide to R](https://www.amazon.com/Beginners-Guide-Use-Alain-Zuur/dp/0387938362/ref=sr_1_43?ie=UTF8&qid=1527788178&sr=8-43&keywords=Use+R)
  
 * There is a series of books called [Use R!](https://www.springer.com/series/6991) put out by Springer with some general and some more specialized topics, many of which are carried 
 by academic libraries. These include texts on e.g. econometrics, ggplot, data wrangling, and so much more! 
 
 * The folks at [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com) have a [list of online resources](https://www.rstudio.com/online-learning/) and also
 produce a number of helpful [webinars](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/) of which the R Studio Essentials is a good starting point.
 
 ### Basically, there are a ton of resources; find one (or several) that you like and jump in!
